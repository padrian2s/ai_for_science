  <h2>Section 2: Tao -- How Mathematics is Changing</h2>

  <div class="transcript">
    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Dimitri (IPAM Director):</span>
    <p>It's a great pleasure to be introducing our wonderful colleague Terry, who will be talking about machine assistance and the future of research mathematics.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Terence Tao (Fields Medalist, UCLA):</span>
    <p>Thank you so much. Welcome. I'm very excited about this event and all the new connections we can make. I think IPAM is all about building connections and this is a great venue to discuss a really important topic.</p>
    <p>I'll be talking about how math is changing. We've seen the hype build up over the last few years -- AI and other tools are becoming more and more capable in math and other tasks. But this is the year where I think it's really beginning to happen.</p>

    <p>And to be honest, math is kind of overdue for some reform, because in many ways we are an extremely conservative discipline -- not in the political sense, but in the sense of practice. I'll give you two examples.</p>

    <p>Here is a memoir from almost exactly 200 years ago -- 201, actually -- introducing most of foundational complex analysis, the Cauchy integral formula for example. The book is written in French and not in LaTeX, but other than that it is almost identical to a textbook that you would see today. The way we teach mathematics has changed only in secondary ways. A graduate student studying complex analysis would basically recognize everything in that book.</p>

    <p>Also, we're still very attached to blackboards. We're almost the only discipline left that still uses them, to the point where photographers think it's an art form. There's actually a coffee table book by Jessica Wynne -- who I know, actually -- which is a very nice book just photographing mathematicians' blackboards as an unusual art form that you don't see anywhere else.</p>

    <p>We don't collaborate very much, at least not until very recently. Even among the other physical scientists -- this is a plot which is already ten years old, just plotting the number of co-authors in a paper between math, chemistry, and physics -- math has been stuck at like one or two collaborators for decades. The other scientists have begun to realize that modern research tasks really require broad collaboration with very diverse sets of people, and we haven't really done that yet. We're kind of missing out on the scaling up or industrialization of science.</p>

    <p>Now there are reasons for that. It's not just because we are antisocial. There is a high barrier to entry -- for a mathematics problem, you often need a math PhD to even understand what the question is. And our standard of proof is extremely high. When we want to prove something, we want every step to be absolutely correct. So if you're collaborating with ten people and one of them is unreliable and producing untrusted arguments, either everybody has to verify everyone else's arguments -- which is very tedious -- or a lot of our workflows don't scale. Blackboards are lovely when you have two or three people. It's an amazing experience to solve a problem at a blackboard with someone who you're really mentally tuned to. But when you have twenty or fifty people working on the problem and they're all in different countries, you can't really solve a problem over Zoom. It doesn't really work.</p>

    <p>So there are reasons why we haven't changed with the times as much as other disciplines. But I think now, with all the technology, this is going to change.</p>

    <p>We are finally in the last year or two beginning to create large-scale projects. The analogy I like to give is that in the experimental sciences there's a distinction between case studies -- where you take one particular object of study and make a very intensive, detailed analysis of that one object -- and population surveys, where you take a population of a thousand members of a species and you do data analysis, statistics, looking at what percentage of your population does this or that.</p>

    <p>We don't do that in math. We haven't had tools that can systematically study large populations of problems -- until now.</p>

    <p>We are finally beginning to do broad participation. In the other sciences, there is citizen science: you can have amateurs collect butterflies, or identify comets, or take water samples. Even if the quality of the data isn't 100% up to scientific standards, there are ways to still use that somewhat noisy data. Until recently, we couldn't do that with math. Outside of a few isolated projects like finding large primes, you couldn't really get amateurs involved. But now we can. We are beginning to have projects where many of the contributors are not professional mathematicians but graduate students, high school students, people from computer science or from the tech industry with some spare time.</p>

    <p>And of course, AI is advancing really rapidly and can really help these projects in real time now, in ways that save more time than they waste. We've passed this crossover point.</p>

    <p>And then there's a secret ingredient that makes all this work: formal verification. There have been a lot of advances in automatically checking whether a certain argument is correct or not. Even if a lot of the contributions coming from AI or from the general public or from a very large-scale project are unreliable, we have ways to filter out the untrustworthy inputs and keep the good ones. That has made a huge difference.</p>

    <p>I've given versions of this talk for several years now, and I've usually pinpointed individual examples of places where AI or neural networks have made some progress. But as I said, we're now entering the era of scale. So I will talk about one large-scale study -- the Erdos problems -- which is the first large dataset of problems for which we can actually apply all these tools and get some idea of which ones are working and what the strengths and weaknesses are.</p>

    <p>The Erdos problems are a collection of about a thousand odd problems, and there's a website started about three years ago by Thomas Bloom to systematically cover these. Erdos was a mathematician active in the 20th century, very prolific -- he authored over 1,500 papers in mathematics. I think that's still the record. He collaborated with everybody. He didn't collaborate with me -- well, when I was ten. That's a picture of myself with Erdos. He loved posing problems. When I met him, he basically just gave me a problem and we worked on it. We didn't solve it. It did get solved later, actually.</p>

    <p>He was famous not just for his research but for posing problems constantly to encourage the community to get interested in the type of mathematics he was promoting. He even attached cash prizes to some of these problems. Most are like fifty dollars, twenty dollars, nothing significant. But there are a few that are really quite influential.</p>

    <p>Here's one of the Erdos problems -- it doesn't matter what it is for the purpose of this talk, but it is one of the most influential questions: how big does a set need to be before you can show that it contains arithmetic progressions? He attached one of the biggest prizes -- five thousand dollars -- to it. It's still open. I've worked on aspects of this problem; there are many partial results that have themselves appeared in top journals. It's a really influential question. He had a knack of asking really good questions that are not impossible, not trivial, but just at the border where any progress would be interesting. Erdos called these problems "acorns" -- requiring deep and subtle new insights from which a mighty oak can develop.</p>

    <p>However, he posed a thousand odd problems. They were not all acorns. Some turn out to be ridiculously easy. Like here's one he posed: there's a certain equation -- n factorial equals x to the k plus or minus y to the k. Are there any solutions? It turned out after a couple decades that you just take a computer to search and the answer is no -- there's a simple counterexample you can just numerically show. Erdos called these "marshmallows" -- serving as a tasty tidbit for a few moments of fleeting enjoyment.</p>

    <p>It's a very diverse set of problems. And I should insert some disclaimers, because recently on social media these AI companies say "we just solved five Erdos problems" -- "oh no, we solved six!" -- and the implication is that this is what mathematicians do all the time, that we are just trying to solve these problems. I should preface this: problem solving is only one aspect of mathematical research. We are also interested in understanding concepts, communicating, and simplifying things. The reason we solve the problems is not so much because the problem itself has all these applications, but because the process of finding the solution often discovers new techniques. The problem of finding arithmetic progressions, for example, led to the whole field of additive combinatorics. It's not just getting the solution, but all the things that come with it when you work towards a solution.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, there are a thousand problems, some solved, some unsolved. To a computer scientist, it looks very much like a benchmark. It is not a benchmark, but it's become a very tempting target because you can actually measure: here's your new AI tool, how many problems does it solve? I think it is a nice dataset to take a snapshot of where these tools are at this moment in time, and you can start doing comparative tests of what types of approaches to using AI are more effective than others.</p>

    <h3>Explained Simply</h3>

    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>What's Happening Here</h4>
      <p>Terence Tao -- widely considered the greatest living mathematician and a Fields Medal winner (the math equivalent of a Nobel Prize) -- opens with a surprisingly candid assessment: mathematics, as a discipline, has barely changed in 200 years. Mathematicians still teach the same way, still use blackboards, and still mostly work alone or in tiny groups. Tao argues that AI, combined with a few other technological developments, is finally forcing math to modernize -- and he thinks that's a good thing.</p>
      <p>He then introduces the idea of using a famous collection of about 1,000 unsolved problems posed by the legendary mathematician Paul Erdos as a testing ground to see what AI can and cannot do in mathematics right now.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="definition-box">
      <strong>Formal Verification:</strong> A process where a computer checks every single step of a mathematical proof to confirm it's logically correct. Think of it like an extremely rigorous spell-checker, but for logic instead of spelling. Mathematicians write their proofs in a special computer language, and the software verifies that no step has a gap or error. This is the "secret ingredient" Tao describes -- it means you can accept contributions from AI or from non-experts, because a computer will catch any mistakes automatically.
    </div>

    <div class="definition-box">
      <strong>Lean (Proof Language):</strong> One of the most popular programming languages used for formal verification in mathematics. Mathematicians write their proofs in Lean, and the Lean software checks every logical step. It's like translating a math proof into code that a computer can audit line by line. Lean has gained significant traction in recent years and is central to many of the large-scale collaborative math projects Tao describes.

    <div class="definition-box">
      <strong>Citizen Science in Mathematics:</strong> The idea that non-professional mathematicians -- students, hobbyists, software engineers -- can contribute meaningfully to mathematical research. Traditionally this was nearly impossible because math has such a high barrier to entry. But with formal verification tools checking the work, and AI helping with routine steps, it's now becoming feasible for a much wider community to participate in solving real mathematical problems.
    </div>

    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
      <p>Tao is making a profound point about the nature of mathematical research. For centuries, math has been a solitary, artisanal craft -- one or two brilliant minds working alone at a blackboard. He's arguing that AI doesn't just help solve problems faster; it fundamentally changes <em>how</em> math can be done by enabling large-scale collaboration for the first time.</p>
      <p>The analogy to "case studies vs. population surveys" is especially revealing. In biology, you can study one organism in depth or survey thousands to find patterns. Math has only ever done the equivalent of case studies -- one problem, one proof, one mathematician. Now, for the first time, mathematicians can do "population-level" research, studying hundreds or thousands of problems at once to find patterns in what makes problems hard or easy, and which AI techniques work best on which types of challenges.</p>
      <p>His careful disclaimer about the Erdos problems is also important. When AI companies announce they've "solved five Erdos problems," the public might think AI is replacing mathematicians. Tao pushes back: solving a specific problem is only a small part of what mathematicians actually care about. The real value is in the new ideas, techniques, and understanding that emerge from <em>working toward</em> a solution. Whether AI can contribute to that deeper process -- not just finding answers, but generating insight -- is the real open question.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Formal verification is the breakthrough that makes everything else possible. Because a computer can automatically check whether a proof is correct, mathematicians can now safely accept contributions from AI systems, non-experts, and massive collaborative teams without worrying about errors slipping through. This removes the single biggest obstacle that kept mathematics from scaling up the way other sciences have.
