    <p>It's a great pleasure to introduce Barry Barish, another speaker that requires no introduction.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Barry Barish:</span>
    <p>I wasn't quite sure what I should talk about today, but I'm going to weave in and out of the big research project that I work on &mdash; the one people know about &mdash; and where AI is making its mark in what we do. But I'd like to reflect a little along the way on AI and physics, and the fact that maybe in some ways physics is a place where it hasn't made the kind of impact you might think it would.</p>

    <p>If we look back at the last century and the advancement of technology, so much of it started with physics of the most fundamental kind. The invention of the laser started with a concept of Einstein's. The MRI machine started with a concept from nuclear physics. Both of those won Nobel Prizes, and later people learned they had applications. AI has made a much slower entry into physics. We use it all over the place, but I don't think in the ways that really push the science forward &mdash; and I'll explain why.</p>

    <p>We started physics as a real subject in the days of Newton, and Newton taught us the scientific method as a way to determine whether what we develop in our laboratories or in our heads is true or not, by testing it against a set of criteria. In the 20th century, that approach got replaced. We still use the scientific method, but it's no longer Newton's steps. Instead, the predominant tool we use to determine whether something we do scientifically is true &mdash; whether it's a breakthrough in science or what we're going to build for a scientific device &mdash; is statistics. It's statistical significance that we use to measure whether something is a true event.</p>

    <p>The real limitation for us in applying AI or machine learning to physics has been that they're basically allergic to each other. We use neural networks, for example, and it's a black box that comes out &mdash; we can't tell what the statistical significance is. If you look at the discovery of the Higgs boson, I know all the background work that was done and all the internal notes, and I know how much modern techniques were used in determining whether it was right or not. But in presenting it to our colleagues, traditional statistical techniques are used to show that it's five sigma.</p>

    <p>So this is the discovery of gravitational waves &mdash; the picture from the Physical Review Letter that we wrote ten years ago. What it shows is the merger of two black holes. The scale from left to right is two-tenths of a second. And the vertical scale is the one that should be impressive: it's a number with a lot of zeros &mdash; 10 to the minus 21. We were able to make an instrument that could measure to some small part of an effect at the level of one part in 10 to the 21.</p>

    <p>The reason there are two graphs is that, in order for confidence and for other reasons, we built two different detectors. Part of the reason is to use two &mdash; and then three &mdash; to point to where something is in the sky. The scale from left to right shows the merger: as the black holes get closer and closer together, the signal gets bigger and bigger, and then they merge.</p>

    <p>The traditional technique we use to find this is what we call template banks. We calculate, using Einstein's equations, every configuration that's kinematically possible between two black holes, or a black hole and a neutron star. We make roughly 250,000 templates that cover the parameter space our instrument can cover. Then we compare the calculated template with the data 250,000 times on every piece of data. That's basically where the events are discovered.</p>

    <p>In AI, we now use convolutional neural networks trained on simulated waveforms, and it enables us to do this more quickly. That's not to me the revolutionary step forward. But "more quickly" does enable us, in terms of gravitational waves, to make a quicker decision to tell astronomers whether we've seen something &mdash; where they might turn their instruments and look at what we're seeing. Speed turns out to be important. Speed is something we can get help from. That's one aspect where we now use these techniques, and this real-time identification with low latency enables us to begin what people like to call multi-messenger astronomy &mdash; that is, we see the same phenomenon in space and look at it in electromagnetic waves of all kinds, possibly neutrinos, and gravitational waves.</p>

    <p>This is LIGO itself. It's a very large instrument, even though it's so precise. The arms are four kilometers long and there are two of them &mdash; one in Hanford, Washington, and one in Livingston, Louisiana. There's a third partner near Pisa in Italy, with a slightly different technical design, but that doesn't matter for today. We proposed this in the early 1990s to the National Science Foundation and they agreed to fund it.</p>

    <p>The job is to compare and measure an effect that's one part in 10 to the 21, which translates, in terms of a kilometer-sized device, to a few parts in 10 to the minus 18 meters. To do that, we have to do interferometry &mdash; something many of you have probably seen in an undergraduate lab somewhere. We have to compare the two arms &mdash; light going down and coming back &mdash; to one part in 10 to the 12th of the wavelength of the light. That's seven or eight orders of magnitude better than anyone had ever done with an interferometer. The second thing we have to do is, even though LIGO is on the Earth's surface, the main problem is the Earth. The Earth shakes &mdash; it's not that solid. We have to basically float the instrument or isolate it from the Earth, getting rid of the Earth's vibrations to one part in 10 to the 12th. Those were the two major problems that took us so many years to solve.</p>

    <p>We made the first detection. It was a merger of two black holes. One was 36 times the mass of our Sun; the other was 29 times the mass of our Sun. That adds up to 65, and you'll notice the final mass we measure is 62 &mdash; which means roughly three solar masses of energy went off in the form of gravitational waves. The distance away was 1.2 billion light years. If we translate what that meant on Earth's surface: we were just evolving from single-cell to multi-cell life on Earth at that time. By the time the signal got to us, we had become us and were able to detect it.</p>

    <p>How quickly do the astronomers need to turn their instruments? Will they miss things?</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--guest">Barry Barish:</span>
    <p>We try to decide in a few minutes. It takes maybe an hour for them to turn their instruments. The signals, depending on the frequency, can last weeks, so it depends what it is. We want to decide in a few seconds, but then we need the ability to say "oops, we were wrong" &mdash; and not do it very often &mdash; maybe a half hour later, so they haven't done much more than mobilize but haven't invested a lot in turning their telescopes in some direction.</p>

    <h3>Explained Simply</h3>

    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>What Are Gravitational Waves?</h4>
      <p>Imagine dropping a bowling ball onto a trampoline. The surface bends and ripples spread outward. Space itself works the same way: when massive objects like black holes accelerate or collide, they create ripples in the fabric of space-time that travel outward at the speed of light. Einstein predicted these waves in 1915, but they are so incredibly faint that it took a full century before we could build an instrument sensitive enough to detect them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>What Is LIGO and How Does It Work?</h4>
      <p>LIGO is essentially the world's most sensitive ruler. It has two L-shaped detectors &mdash; one in Washington state and one in Louisiana &mdash; each with arms stretching four kilometers long. A laser beam is split in two and sent down each arm, bouncing off mirrors and returning. If a gravitational wave passes through, it stretches one arm and squeezes the other by an impossibly tiny amount. The laser can detect that difference. Having two detectors thousands of kilometers apart lets scientists confirm a signal is real (not just local noise) and triangulate where in the sky the signal came from.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>Why Is Detection So Hard?</h4>
      <p>Barish emphasizes the measurement scale: 10 to the minus 21. To put that in perspective, they're measuring a change in the length of a 4-kilometer arm that is about one-thousandth the diameter of a proton. They need to measure one part in a trillion of the wavelength of light &mdash; seven or eight orders of magnitude beyond what any interferometer had done before. And they have to isolate from the constant shaking of the Earth itself, which vibrates far more than the gravitational wave signal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>How Template Matching Works</h4>
      <p>Scientists can't just "listen" for gravitational waves and hope to recognize them. Instead, they use Einstein's equations to pre-calculate what every possible collision of two massive objects would look like &mdash; every combination of masses, spins, and orientations. This produces about 250,000 templates. When data comes in, each template is compared against the data to see if there's a match. It's like having a library of 250,000 audio fingerprints and checking every recording against all of them. AI (specifically convolutional neural networks) now helps do this comparison faster, enabling real-time alerts to astronomers rather than replacing the fundamental detection method.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>The First Detection</h4>
      <p>The first gravitational wave event ever detected was the merger of two black holes &mdash; one 36 times the mass of our Sun, the other 29 times. When they merged, the final black hole was only 62 solar masses, meaning about three solar masses' worth of energy was radiated away purely as gravitational waves. The event happened 1.2 billion light years away, meaning the signal had been traveling through space since before complex life existed on Earth.</p>

      <strong>Gravitational Waves:</strong> Ripples in the fabric of space-time caused by the acceleration of massive objects, such as colliding black holes or neutron stars. Predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1915 and first directly detected by LIGO in 2015.
    </div>

    <div class="definition-box">
      <strong>LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory):</strong> A pair of enormous L-shaped detectors in the United States (Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA) that use laser interferometry to detect gravitational waves. Each arm is 4 kilometers long. A third partner detector, Virgo, operates near Pisa, Italy.
    </div>

    <div class="definition-box">
      <strong>Interferometry:</strong> A measurement technique that splits a beam of light into two paths, sends them in different directions, and recombines them. Any difference in the distance traveled by the two beams shows up as an interference pattern. LIGO uses this principle at an extraordinary level of precision &mdash; measuring to one part in a trillion of the wavelength of light.
    </div>

    <div class="definition-box">
      <strong>Template Banks:</strong> A library of roughly 250,000 pre-computed waveform patterns, each representing a different possible gravitational wave event (different masses, spins, and configurations). Incoming data is compared against every template to identify matches, providing a statistically rigorous way to confirm detections.
    </div>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Key Insight &mdash; The Scale of Measurement:</strong> LIGO measures distortions at the level of 10 to the minus 21 &mdash; that is, 0.000000000000000000001. In practical terms, this means detecting a change in the length of a 4-kilometer arm that is roughly one-thousandth the width of a proton. This is the most precise measurement ever achieved by a scientific instrument, and it is why gravitational wave detection required decades of engineering breakthroughs before it became possible.
