  <h2>Section 1: Welcome & Mission</h2>

  <div class="transcript">
    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Dimitri (IPAM Director):</span>
    <p>Good morning everyone. My name is Dimitri. I'm the director of IPAM and also a professor of mathematics here. It's a great pleasure to welcome all of you here to IPAM for this event that we're doing jointly with the S Foundation.</p>
    <p>Just a few words about us and what this event is about. IPAM is one of several NSF-funded math institutes in the United States. We have a mission to make connections through mathematics. We run a variety of programs, from a day long to several months long, focused on all kinds of areas that involve mathematics in one way or another. This could be programs in mathematics itself or programs that connect mathematics to other things.</p>
    <p>Of course, it's all about AI nowadays. AI is a fantastic thing that is going to have a huge effect on just about everything we do -- how we do science, how we do higher education. Chuck, who got connected to us about half a year ago this summer, had this vision to create a forum for us to make connections between science, between industry, and to have mathematics as the foundation of all of this. And so came this idea of having a foundation, the S Foundation.</p>
    <p>IPAM is a very natural place to do this. We've been a player in the AI space for many, many years. In fact, I was looking back and in 2011 -- fifteen years ago -- we had a program that started doing machine learning in physics of materials and material science. And then we had a summer school co-organized with people like Yann LeCun and others who really ended the AI winter. Since then we've had many programs of various kinds.</p>
    <p>But this event is unique because we really would like to provide space for people to make connections between ideas that lie in science, ideas that lie in AI, ideas that lie in industry, and get a conversation going.</p>
    <p>I'm also very grateful to Miguel, who is our dean of physical sciences. UCLA is getting very entrepreneurial. We are going to plan a research park, and the physical sciences is one of the more entrepreneurial divisions at UCLA. Part of it is really to enable our faculty to explore all kinds of ideas in commercialization -- be it scientific ideas but also ideas from higher education, which of course by necessity is undergoing a huge change. That explains the three panels that we're going to have: a panel on AI and mathematics, a panel on AI for industry, and AI in higher education.</p>
    <p>Let me just hand it over to Chuck who will say a few words about the S Foundation.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Chuck (S Foundation):</span>
    <p>Well, thank you very much and welcome everyone. Really happy that everyone is here joining us for this exciting full-day event. I want to acknowledge our very important host, IPAM, so thank you so much for the partnership here.</p>
    <p>We are very excited because we actually have speakers, participants, and guests coming from all over the country -- as a matter of fact, all over the world. Thank you to Bone Capital for being a sponsor for lunch.</p>
    <p>I really want to emphasize how important it is at this critical time for academia, industry, the entrepreneurial community, founders, donors, and philanthropists to work together. I think one word to describe myself, for those who know me: my lifetime journey has been about building bridges. And I'm really excited that we're building bridges between industry and academia, between researchers and entrepreneurs, and across our global community.</p>
    <p>Why now? It comes at a very critical time. As Dimitri mentioned, the rapid rise of AI is shaping science, shaping economies, and shaping our society. A trusted, scientifically grounded AI has never been more important. Our mission really has two core ideas: AI for science and science for AI. We want to bring researchers, industry, entrepreneurs, and private funding together to build an ecosystem that benefits all of humanity.</p>
    <p>In closing, this is just the beginning. This is our first step in a much larger effort. Thank you to those who are online, because this is actually being broadcast through our partners globally to millions of viewers. You in-person attendees are the privileged few, so thank you for joining us. I'm excited for the program.</p>

    <span class="speaker speaker--host">Dimitri (IPAM Director):</span>
    <p>Thank you so much, Chuck. Thank you for the kind words and again, thank you all for coming. I guess we should just get started -- it's a little early but it is what it is. Terry, you might be able to have a few more minutes for your talk. It's a great pleasure to be introducing our wonderful colleague Terry, who will be talking about machine assistance and the future of research mathematics.</p>

    <h3>Explained Simply</h3>

    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>What's Happening Here</h4>
      <p>This is the opening of a full-day conference at UCLA about how artificial intelligence is transforming science. Two organizers -- the director of a major math institute and the founder of a new nonprofit -- welcome the audience and set the stage for the day's conversations. They explain why this gathering is happening now and what they hope to accomplish.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="definition-box">
      <strong>IPAM (Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics):</strong> A research institute at UCLA funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Its mission is to bring together mathematicians with scientists, engineers, and industry professionals to collaborate on problems where math can make a difference. IPAM runs workshops and long-term programs -- think of it as a meeting ground where people from different fields come together to work on hard problems using mathematics.
    </div>

    <div class="definition-box">
      <strong>S Foundation:</strong> A newly created charitable organization whose mission is "AI for science and science for AI." It aims to build bridges between academic researchers, industry, entrepreneurs, and philanthropists to ensure that AI development is scientifically grounded and benefits humanity broadly. This conference is one of its first public events.

      <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
      <p>This event sits at a crossroads moment. AI capabilities are advancing so fast that the academic world, the tech industry, and government are all scrambling to figure out what it means for their work. Dimitri's point about IPAM hosting an AI-related program back in 2011 -- well before the current AI boom -- shows that mathematics has been intertwined with AI development for longer than most people realize. The fact that Yann LeCun (one of the "godfathers" of deep learning and a Turing Award winner) co-organized early programs at IPAM underscores the institute's deep roots in this space.</p>
      <p>Chuck's framing of "AI for science and science for AI" captures a two-way relationship: AI tools can accelerate scientific discovery, but rigorous science is also needed to make AI itself more trustworthy and capable. The emphasis on building bridges -- between academia and industry, between different countries and disciplines -- reflects a growing consensus that the challenges and opportunities of AI are too big for any single institution or sector to tackle alone.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Key Insight:</strong> This conference represents a deliberate effort to break down the traditional walls between academic mathematics, scientific research, and the tech industry. The organizers believe that the AI moment is so significant that these communities must work together -- not just to use AI tools, but to shape how AI develops in a scientifically responsible way.
